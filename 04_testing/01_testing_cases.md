# Test Cases

Run both cases separately. Calculate expected labor cost and total before each run.

From the repository folder, run:

```text
python 03_execution/freelance_quote_builder.py
```

For each case, paste the terminal input and output as evidence. Mark Pass or Fail and briefly explain why. A passing run has correct amounts, a cleaned client name, the `PROJECT ESTIMATE` heading, labeled costs, and dollars with two decimal places.

## Case 1: Ordinary values

Enter:

- Client name: `Alex Taylor`
- Estimated hours: `4`
- Hourly rate: `30`
- Direct expenses: `15`

**Expected labor cost and total:**  
Labor cost: `$120.00`  
Total: `$135.00`

**Evidence (paste your terminal run):**

```text
Client Name: Alex Taylor
Hours Worked: 4
Hourly Rate: 30
Direct Expenses: 15

PROJECT ESTIMATE
Client Name: Alex Taylor
Labor Cost: $120.00
Direct Expenses: $15.00
Total Esitmate: $135.00
```

**Pass / Fail and why:**
Test passed as the output matches the expected values.

## Case 2: Partial hours and text cleanup

Enter:

- Client name: `  aLEX tAYLOR  ` (include two spaces before and after the name)
- Estimated hours: `2.5`
- Hourly rate: `30`
- Direct expenses: `0`

The displayed name should be `Alex Taylor` without surrounding spaces.

**Expected labor cost and total:**  
Labor cost: `$75.00`  
Total: `$75.00`

**Evidence (paste your terminal run):**

```text
Client Name:   aLEX tAYLOR  
Hours Worked: 2.5
Hourly Rate: 30
Direct Expenses: 0

PROJECT ESTIMATE
Client Name: Alex Taylor
Labor Cost: $75.00
Direct Expenses: $0.00
Total Esitmate: $75.00
```

**Pass / Fail and why:**
Test passed as the output matches the expected values.
